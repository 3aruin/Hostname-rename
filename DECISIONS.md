## Current State — v2 Audit

Reviewed files: `launcher.ps1`, `network.ps1`, `device.ps1`, `naming.ps1`, `rename.ps1`, `tools/Get-Hashes.ps1`, `README.md`

### What is solid and should be kept

| Area | Verdict |
|---|---|
| Parallel module fetching via `Start-Job` in launcher | ✅ Keep — meaningfully cuts load time |
| SHA-256 manifest integrity check | ✅ Keep — core security model |
| Self-elevation with UAC-hop + parameter forwarding | ✅ Keep — well-implemented |
| Parallel CIM queries in `Get-DeviceType` | ✅ Keep — ~2/3 detection time reduction |
| 15-character name truncation logic in `New-DeviceName` | ✅ Keep — Windows NetBIOS limit compliance |
| 8-second timed mode prompt with `[Console]::KeyAvailable` | ✅ Keep — correct approach for console sessions |
| Serial cleaning (`-replace '[^A-Za-z0-9]'`) | ✅ Keep |
| Entra UPN stripping in `Get-UserName` (`@` and `_` separators) | ✅ Keep |

## Decisions — Architecture

### ADR-001 · Module loading model: remote fetch + dot-source

**Status:** Accepted (carry forward to v3)  
**Decision:** Modules are fetched over HTTPS at runtime, hash-verified, then dot-sourced into the launcher's scope. No local install step is required.  
**Rationale:** Enables the one-liner `irm | iex` deployment pattern that is the primary use case. Hash pinning to a commit SHA compensates for the lack of a local file.  
**Constraint:** Every published change requires regenerating the manifest via `Get-Hashes.ps1` and committing before the URL is safe for production.

---

### ADR-002 · Pin to full commit SHA, never `main`

**Status:** Accepted (carry forward to v3)  
**Action:** ✅ CI lint step added in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (job: `placeholder`) — fails any branch that pushes `launcher.ps1` with `REPLACE_WITH_COMMIT_SHA` still present. The check uses `continue-on-error: true` on `main` only, so the canonical repo can keep the default template state without breaking CI; all other branches get hard enforcement.  
**Decision:** The README and inline comments require deployments to pin to a full 40-character commit SHA in the `iwr` URL.  
**Rationale:** `main` is a moving target. A branch ref can be force-pushed. Commit SHAs are immutable; they are the only ref that makes the manifest hash check meaningful.

---

### ADR-003 · Naming modes: Gateway vs User

**Status:** Accepted (carry forward to v3)  
**Decision:** Two naming modes exist:
- **Gateway** — `{ORG}{WH}{LOC}-{DEPT}{TYPE}-{SERIAL}`
- **User** — `{WH}{LOC}-{Name}`

**Rationale:** Gateway mode is the standard, automation-friendly path. User mode handles edge cases (hot-desks, unassigned devices given to a specific person) without requiring a full naming schema.  
**Note:** The `-Folder` switch triggers User mode. README now correctly documents that it reads from `C:\Users` profile directories.

---

### ADR-004 · Organisation data lives in `network.ps1`, not a config file

**Status:** Accepted — implemented in v3  
**Decision (v2):** Gateway-to-site mappings and ORG codes are hardcoded in `$GATEWAY_MAP` inside `network.ps1`.  
**Problem for open source:** The file shipped with real internal IP ranges and the `RB` organisation code.  
**Decision for v3:** Replace real entries with clearly labelled example data using RFC 5737 documentation-range IPs. Add a `# -- CONFIGURE YOUR SITES HERE --` comment block. Add a configurable `$FALLBACK_CONTEXT` variable so fallback behaviour is also forkable without touching function code.  
**Implemented:** All six `10.72.x.x` entries replaced with `192.0.2.x`, `198.51.100.x`, and `203.0.113.x` ranges. Example ORG code is now `AC`. `$FALLBACK_CONTEXT` added as a named, commented variable.  
**Externalisation pattern:** ✅ Documented in `CONTRIBUTING.md` under "Externalising `$GATEWAY_MAP` to a separate file" — covers the `config.ps1` pattern, load order in `$MODULES`, and manifest implications.

---

### ADR-005 · No external dependencies

**Status:** Accepted (carry forward to v3)  
**Decision:** The tool uses only built-in PowerShell cmdlets and .NET types. No third-party modules.  
**Rationale:** Target machines may be freshly imaged; module availability cannot be assumed. The deployment model (MDM, `irm | iex`) makes dependency installation impractical.

---

### ADR-006 · ORG code must be exactly two characters

**Status:** Accepted — documented in v3  
**Decision:** The `ORG` segment in the Gateway naming scheme is constrained to exactly two characters.  
**Rationale:** Windows enforces a 15-character NetBIOS limit on hostnames. The full Gateway name `{ORG}{WH}{LOC}-{DEPT}{TYPE}-{SERIAL}` with minimum-length segments is `AA00A-AABB-0000` = exactly 15 characters when ORG is two characters. A three-character ORG pushes the full name to 16 characters, which `Rename-Computer` will reject.  
**Implication for naming:** Organisations should derive a two-character code from their full name (e.g. ACME Corporation → `AC`, Riverside Brick → `RB`). The fallback context ORG should also be two characters and visually distinct from any real site code (e.g. `XX`).  
**Documented in:** README Name Format section.

---

### ADR-007 · Suppress `PSAvoidUsingWriteHost` project-wide

**Status:** Accepted — implemented in v3 (2026-04-30)  
**Decision:** A project-level `PSScriptAnalyzerSettings.psd1` excludes the `PSAvoidUsingWriteHost` rule. The `lint` job in `ci.yml` passes the file to `Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer` via `-Settings`.  
**Rationale:** This tool's user surface is the PowerShell console — interactive menus (mode selection, profile picker), confirmations, and operator-visible status messages. The two PSScriptAnalyzer-recommended alternatives both break the tool:

| Alternative | Why it fails here |
|---|---|
| `Write-Output` | Writes to the success stream. PowerShell function return values *are* the success stream, so prompt and status text would be returned alongside the actual return value (e.g. `Get-Department` would return both the printed prompt text and the dept code), corrupting every caller. |
| `Write-Information` | Invisible unless the caller sets `$InformationPreference = 'Continue'` or passes `-InformationAction Continue`. End users running a one-shot `irm \| iex` will not have set this. The prompts would simply not appear. |

`Write-Host` is the intended cmdlet for interactive UI in PowerShell 5+ (the underlying issue the rule was created for — "you can't capture or redirect it" — was resolved when `Write-Host` was rewritten to write to the information stream in PS 5.0). The rule remains useful for catching cases where someone wrote a function meant to *return* data but printed it instead; that is not what is happening in this codebase.

**Scope of the suppression:** the rule is excluded for *all* `.ps1` files in the repo. `Write-Verbose` is still used for debug-level detail throughout, so the verbose/host distinction is preserved at the source-code level even though only one of them is enforced.

**Alternative considered:** per-function suppression via `[Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.SuppressMessageAttribute('PSAvoidUsingWriteHost', '')]`. Rejected because every interactive function in the codebase would need the attribute, and any new interactive function would silently re-introduce the warning until someone added it. A single project-level decision documented here and in the settings file is clearer.

## Known Bugs

### BUG-001 · `-FolderPath` and `-Username` parameters documented but not implemented

**Severity:** High — README documents parameters that do not exist in code  
**Status:** ✅ Resolved in v3 (README) — Option 3 chosen  
**Location:** `README.md` (Available Parameters table) vs `launcher.ps1` (param block) vs `rename.ps1` (param block) vs `device.ps1 → Get-UserName`  

**Was:** README claimed `-FolderPath` and `-Username` as implemented parameters. Folder mode was described as "reads Desktop subfolders" — the implementation reads `C:\Users` profile directories.

**Resolution (Option 3 — Defer to v3.1):**
- `-FolderPath` and `-Username` moved to the bottom of the Available Parameters table, marked *(planned — v3.1)*
- `-Folder` description corrected: now documents `C:\Users` profile directory selection accurately
- No code changes required for this resolution; plumbing deferred to v3.1

**v3.1 action:** Implement `-FolderPath [string]` and `-Username [string]` across the full call chain — `launcher.ps1` param block → `Rename-DeviceSmart` → `Get-UserName`. Add partial-name matching to `Get-UserName`.

---

### BUG-002 · Fallback ORG code `RS` in `Get-NetworkContext` is org-specific

**Severity:** Medium  
**Status:** ✅ Resolved in v3 — Option D chosen  
**Location:** `network.ps1 → Get-NetworkContext`, `rename.ps1 → Rename-DeviceSmart`

**Was:**
```powershell
return @{ ORG = "RS"; WH = "XX"; LOC = "X" }
```
The fallback silently inserted `RS` (Riverside Brick's internal signal code) regardless of who was running the tool. Meaningless to any other organisation, and the silent behaviour was equally wrong in both interactive and automated deployments.

**Resolution (Option D — configurable fallback context + throw in NonInteractive):**

`network.ps1` — two changes:
1. Hardcoded fallback replaced with a named, configurable variable:
   ```powershell
   $script:FALLBACK_CONTEXT = @{ ORG = "XX"; WH = "99"; LOC = "X" }
   ```
   `ORG = "XX"` and `WH = "99"` are deliberate sentinel values — clearly not a real site, and queryable in AD/Intune. Users set their own "signal" ORG (e.g. Riverside Brick keeps `RS` as their fallback; ACME Corporation might use `AX`).

2. `Get-NetworkContext` gains a `-NonInteractive` switch with split behaviour:
   - **NonInteractive:** throws immediately with an actionable error message. A silently incorrect device name in an MDM deployment is worse than a hard stop — the gateway must be added to `$GATEWAY_MAP` before redeploying.
   - **Interactive:** emits a four-line `Write-Warning` block (blank warning lines above and below force yellow console output that cannot be missed), then returns `$FALLBACK_CONTEXT`. The technician gets a working name with sentinel values they can identify and correct later.

`rename.ps1` — one change: `-NonInteractive:$NonInteractive` forwarded to `Get-NetworkContext` so the throw/warn split works end-to-end. Inline comment explains the reason for the passthrough.

### BUG-003 · CIM job objects not cleaned up on detection error

**Severity:** Low  
**Status:** ✅ Resolved — fix confirmed in pre-launch audit (2026-04-30)  
**Location:** `device.ps1 → Get-DeviceType`

**Was:** Three separate named job variables (`$osJob`, `$csJob`, `$cpuJob`) each removed inline with `Remove-Job` immediately after `Receive-Job`. If any call threw before reaching its `Remove-Job`, that job object leaked for the duration of the session.

**Resolution:** `$jobs = @()` declared before the `try` block (guaranteeing `finally` always has a valid reference, even if `Get-CimInstance` throws before the array is assigned). All three jobs collected into the array in a single assignment inside `try`. Retrieved by index (`$jobs[0]`, `$jobs[1]`, `$jobs[2]`). A single `finally` block pipes the whole array to `Remove-Job -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue`, cleaning up regardless of how the `try` block exited.

**Audit note (2026-04-30):** This fix was described in DECISIONS.md and marked ✅ Done, but a pre-launch code audit revealed the fix had never been applied to the file — `device.ps1` still contained the original three named job variables with inline `Remove-Job` calls and no `finally` block. The fix was applied for real at this point. When closing a bug, always verify the change is present in the actual file, not just described here.

---

### BUG-004 · `Get-UserName` uses partial `-Username` match description in comments but has no such parameter

**Severity:** Low — internal comment inconsistency, linked to BUG-001  
**Status:** ✅ Resolved in v3 — closed alongside BUG-001  
**Location:** `device.ps1 → Get-UserName` `.SYNOPSIS` / README `-Username` description  
**Resolution:** README updated to mark `-Username` as planned v3.1. No code changes required at this stage.

---

### BUG-005 · Null/empty gateway produces a misleading error message

**Severity:** Low  
**Status:** ✅ Resolved in pre-launch audit (2026-04-30)  
**Location:** `network.ps1 → Get-DefaultGateway`, `network.ps1 → Get-NetworkContext`

**Was:** `Get-DefaultGateway` returns `$null` when no enabled network adapter has a default gateway. PowerShell hashtable lookups on `$null` return `$null` silently, so execution fell through to the GATEWAY_MAP error path. The resulting message read:

```
Gateway '' was not found in GATEWAY_MAP. Add it to network.ps1 and redeploy. ...
```

An empty-string gateway is not a missing map entry — it means the device has no network connection. The error was technically correct but pointed the operator at the wrong fix.

**Resolution:** `Get-NetworkContext` now opens with an `[string]::IsNullOrEmpty($Gateway)` guard that throws before the map lookup with the message:

```
No default gateway was detected on this machine. Ensure the device has a
network connection before running this tool.
```

This condition is treated as always-fatal (no interactive/NonInteractive split) since no gateway means the tool cannot determine location under either mode.

### BUG-006 · PSScriptAnalyzer lint failures on first CI run

**Severity:** Medium — blocks CI, so blocks PR merges  
**Status:** ✅ Resolved in v3 (2026-04-30)  
**Location:** `device.ps1`, `naming.ps1`, `rename.ps1`, `network.ps1`, `tests/Hostname-Rename.Tests.ps1`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Was:** The first run of `Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer` against the v3 codebase (under the new CI pipeline from OQ-005) emitted 15 warnings across three rules. Until resolved, the `lint` job failed on every push, blocking merges.

| Rule | Files | Count |
|---|---|---|
| `PSAvoidUsingWriteHost` | `device.ps1`, `rename.ps1`, `naming.ps1`* | 12 |
| `PSUseBOMForUnicodeEncodedFile` | `network.ps1`, `rename.ps1`, `tests/Hostname-Rename.Tests.ps1` | 3 |
| `PSUseDeclaredVarsMoreThanAssignments` | `tests/Hostname-Rename.Tests.ps1` | 1 |

*\*The CI output as recorded only showed `device.ps1` and `rename.ps1` for `PSAvoidUsingWriteHost`, but `naming.ps1` contains 8 functionally identical `Write-Host` calls in `Select-NamingMode`. The output appears to have been truncated. The fix covers all three files either way.*

**Resolution — three sub-fixes, one bug entry:**

**6a. `PSAvoidUsingWriteHost`** → see ADR-007. Excluded project-wide via the new `PSScriptAnalyzerSettings.psd1`. The lint job in `ci.yml` passes the file to `Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer` with `-Settings ./PSScriptAnalyzerSettings.psd1`.

**6b. `PSUseBOMForUnicodeEncodedFile`** → non-ASCII characters replaced with ASCII equivalents in three files:

| File | Characters replaced |
|---|---|
| `network.ps1` | em dash `—` → `--` (2 occurrences in comment lines) |
| `rename.ps1` | box drawing `──` → `--`, `─` → `-` (User-mode and Gateway-mode section dividers) |
| `tests/Hostname-Rename.Tests.ps1` | `─` → `-`, `→` → `->`, `—` → `--` (all section dividers and inline arrows) |

**Alternative considered:** add a UTF-8 BOM to each file. Rejected because:
- It changes the byte content of `network.ps1`, which would force a manifest rehash and a new deployed commit SHA purely for cosmetic comment characters
- The hashing path in `launcher.ps1` (`Get-Content -Raw -Encoding UTF8` then `[Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes()`) handles BOMs differently across PS 5.1 and 7.x — a BOM at the source could subtly shift hashes between environments and undermine the integrity check
- ASCII keeps the integrity model unambiguous and the diff to `$MANIFEST` is the absolute minimum

**6c. `PSUseDeclaredVarsMoreThanAssignments`** → in the `Get-UserName name cleaning` Describe block of the test file, `$clean` was set in `BeforeAll` and used inside `It` blocks. PSScriptAnalyzer cannot trace state across that boundary and flagged the assignment as unused. The variable was promoted to `$script:clean` (the documented Pester v5 pattern for cross-block state); the assignment and all eight call sites updated. No runtime behaviour change.

**Why this happened only now:** v3 is the first version with CI. v2 was internally deployed and never lint-checked. All three rules have been firing since v2 but went unobserved.

### BUG-007 · `PSUseUsingScopeModifierInNewRunspaces` false positive in launcher fetch loop

**Severity:** Medium — blocks the `lint` CI job  
**Status:** ✅ Resolved in v3 (2026-04-30)  
**Location:** `launcher.ps1` (parallel module-fetch loop, lines 132-141)

**Was:** The fetch loop used the standard `Start-Job ... -ArgumentList` pattern with a matching `param()` block inside the scriptblock:

```powershell
$jobs[$FileName] = Start-Job -ScriptBlock {
    param($u)
    (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $u -UseBasicParsing).Content
} -ArgumentList $url
```

`$u` *is* declared inside the scriptblock (by the `param` block) and *is* bound at `Start-Job` time (via `-ArgumentList`). The pattern is functionally correct and well-documented for PowerShell jobs. PSScriptAnalyzer's `PSUseUsingScopeModifierInNewRunspaces` rule has a known limitation: its static check doesn't recognise `param()` blocks inside scriptblocks passed to `Start-Job` / `Invoke-Command`, so it flags both the param declaration *and* every reference to the param variable as undeclared cross-runspace references.

**Resolution:** Switched to the `$using:` scope modifier:

```powershell
$jobs[$FileName] = Start-Job -ScriptBlock {
    (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $using:url -UseBasicParsing).Content
}
```

`$using:url` snapshots the loop variable's *current* value into each job's runspace at `Start-Job` time, which preserves the per-iteration correctness of the original pattern (each job fetches the URL for its own iteration, not a shared late-bound reference). Functionally equivalent to the original.

**Alternative considered:** suppress the rule via `[Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.SuppressMessageAttribute]` on the function or add it to `PSScriptAnalyzerSettings.psd1`. Rejected — `PSUseUsingScopeModifierInNewRunspaces` catches genuine bugs (silently failing cross-runspace variable references) and there's no reason to disable it project-wide for a single-line idiomatic fix that resolves the false positive cleanly. The fix is the *more* idiomatic form for `Start-Job` in modern PowerShell anyway.

**Note for the manifest:** `launcher.ps1` is not in `$MANIFEST` (it cannot hash itself), so this change doesn't require regenerating module hashes. It does require a new commit SHA in deployment URLs as usual.

### BUG-008 · Pester v5 test container failed before any test ran

**Severity:** Medium — blocks the `test` CI job  
**Status:** ✅ Resolved in v3 (2026-04-30)  
**Location:** `tests/Hostname-Rename.Tests.ps1` (`Describe "Get-SerialLast4"`)

**Was:** First end-to-end run of the Pester job — after BUG-006/BUG-007 unblocked the lint stage and the `Run.PassThru` config fix unblocked `Invoke-Pester` itself — produced:

```
Pester v5.7.1
Starting discovery in 1 files.
Discovery found 38 tests in 234ms.
Running tests.
[-] tests\Hostname-Rename.Tests.ps1 failed with:
Message
Tests completed in 723ms
Tests Passed: 0, Failed: 38, Container failed: 1
```

All 38 tests reported failed with no individual error messages — the diagnostic signature of a container-level failure during Run phase. Two interacting defects in the `Get-SerialLast4` Describe block:

**1. Discovery-phase variable referenced at Run phase.** In the second Context, the helper scriptblock was defined at Context body level:

```powershell
Context "Serial shorter than 4 chars" {
    $fn = { param($s) ... }                # <- runs during Discovery
    It "3 chars -> left-pads to 4" {
        & $fn "ABC" | Should -Be "0ABC"    # <- runs during Run; $fn is $null
    }
}
```

Per the Pester v5 breaking-changes documentation:
> *Variables defined during Discovery, are not available in BeforeAll/-Each, AfterAll/-Each and It.*

`$fn` was assigned at Discovery, then `It` blocks invoked `& $null` at Run time, which throws.

**2. Malformed `InModuleScope` call.** The first `It` block contained:

```powershell
InModuleScope -Scriptblock {
    # Mock CIM since we only want to test the logic
}
```

— missing the required `-ModuleName` parameter, with an empty (commented-out) body. Leftover scaffolding for a mock that was never written. Throws at Run time regardless of the `$fn` issue.

**Resolution:**
- Hoisted the helper scriptblock into a Describe-level `BeforeAll` assigned to `$script:fn` — the documented Pester v5 cross-block pattern, same approach used for `$script:clean` in BUG-006c.
- Deleted the malformed `InModuleScope` block.
- Deduplicated the three inline copies of the helper that had been in the first Context's `It` blocks (assigned to local `$fn` each time, which worked but was repetitive). All seven `It` blocks across both Contexts now call the single `$script:fn`.

**Test count unchanged:** 38 tests before, 38 tests after. No assertion logic changed — the helper's body is byte-identical to the previous inline copies. The fix only changes *where* the helper lives, so it's accessible at Run time.

**Why the original error was missing.** Pester's `Detailed` verbosity renders container-level errors as `failed with:\nMessage\n` — the exception object is captured in the result, but the `.Message` property's contents aren't formatted to console at this verbosity for container failures specifically. Diagnosing required reading the test source to spot the Discovery/Run scope boundary. Bumping verbosity to `Diagnostic` in `ci.yml` would surface the underlying exception in future runs, at the cost of much noisier successful runs (every mock setup, every internal step). Left at `Detailed` since the root cause is now understood and documented; revisit if a similar opaque container failure recurs.

**Why this surfaced now:** v3 is the first version with a CI test pipeline. v2 had no tests in CI. The defects existed in the test file as written but were never exercised until the lint and `Invoke-Pester`-call issues were resolved.

## Open Questions for v3

### OQ-001 · Should logging be implemented?

**Background:** No logging code exists anywhere in the codebase. The README previously listed "Network access to log share *(optional)*" under Requirements — this entry has been removed in v3 as there is nothing to back it up. The question of whether logging should be added remains open.  
**Options:**
- A. Skip logging entirely and remove the README mention
- B. Add a lightweight `Write-Log` wrapper that writes to a UNC path if reachable, local temp otherwise
- C. Add optional `-LogPath [string]` parameter

**Recommendation:** Option B with Option C as the override. Keep it opt-in — logging should never block a rename.  
**Status:** ⬜ Open — deferred to v3.1

---

### OQ-002 · Should there be a dry-run / `-WhatIf` mode?

**Background:** `Rename-Computer` supports `-WhatIf` natively. The orchestrator does not expose it.  
**Value:** Useful for MDM testing — verify what name *would* be generated without actually renaming.  
**Recommendation:** Add `[CmdletBinding(SupportsShouldProcess)]` to `Rename-DeviceSmart` and pass `-WhatIf:$WhatIfPreference` to `Rename-Computer`.  
**Status:** ⬜ Open — deferred to v3.1

---

### OQ-003 · Should `Get-DeviceType` detect tablets / Surface / convertibles?

**Background:** The current detection chain covers VM, Server, ARM/Mobile, Laptop, Desktop. Tablet/Surface form factors (e.g., Windows tablets, Surface Go) may fall through to `DT`.  
**Detection signal:** `Win32_SystemEnclosure.ChassisTypes` includes types 30 (Tablet) and 31 (Convertible).  
**Recommendation:** Add as an optional enhancement; does not block v3.  
**Status:** ⬜ Open — deferred to v3.1 alongside `PB` device type

---

### OQ-004 · Should the naming mode timed prompt timeout be configurable?

**Background:** The 8-second timeout in `Select-NamingMode` is hardcoded.  
**Value:** Teams with slow startup environments may want more time; MDM users never need it.  
**Recommendation:** Low priority. The `-NonInteractive` flag already bypasses the prompt entirely. Leave hardcoded for now; documented as a "fork and adjust" customisation point in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.  
**Status:** ⬜ Open — accepted as-is for v3; revisit only if a real need is reported

---

### OQ-005 · GitHub Actions CI pipeline

**Background:** No CI existed. For a public repo, some automation is expected.  
**Status:** ✅ Implemented — `.github/workflows/ci.yml` added (2026-04-30)

**Delivered — four jobs:**

| Job | What it does |
|---|---|
| `lint` | PSScriptAnalyzer on all `.ps1` files, targeting PS 5.1 and 7.x via matrix |
| `test` | Pester v5 unit tests in `./tests/`, uploads NUnit XML results as an artifact |
| `manifest` | Parses `$MANIFEST` from `launcher.ps1` and recomputes SHA-256 for each module file; fails if any hash mismatches |
| `placeholder` | Fails any branch pushing `launcher.ps1` with `REPLACE_WITH_COMMIT_SHA` present; `continue-on-error: true` on `main` only |

The `manifest` job supersedes the manual `Get-Hashes.ps1` verification step for PRs — it catches the case where module files are changed but `launcher.ps1` is not updated before merge.

## File-by-File Notes

### `launcher.ps1`
- Core model is sound; carry forward as-is structurally
- Param block needs `-FolderPath` and `-Username` once BUG-001 is resolved in v3.1
- `$REPO_BASE` hardcodes the author's GitHub path — fine for the canonical repo, documented for forks in `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- ✅ Parallel fetch loop switched from `param/-ArgumentList` to `$using:url` (BUG-007). Functionally equivalent; resolves a PSScriptAnalyzer false positive without disabling the rule.

### `network.ps1`
- ✅ All six `10.72.x.x` entries replaced with RFC 5737 documentation IPs (ADR-004)
- ✅ `$FALLBACK_CONTEXT` variable added — replaces hardcoded `RS` fallback (BUG-002)
- ✅ `Get-NetworkContext` updated — throws in NonInteractive, warns prominently in interactive (BUG-002)
- ✅ Null/empty gateway guard added to `Get-NetworkContext` — throws with a clear "no gateway detected" message before the map lookup (BUG-005)
- ✅ Two em dashes (`—`) in comment lines 7 and 56 replaced with `--` (BUG-006b)

### `device.ps1`
- ✅ CIM job cleanup fixed — `$jobs` array + `finally` block (BUG-003; fix confirmed and applied in pre-launch audit 2026-04-30)
- BUG-001 (`-FolderPath` / `-Username`) deferred to v3.1 — `Get-UserName` unchanged for now
- `$script:VALID_DEPARTMENTS` and `$script:DEVICE_TYPES` documented in README as extension points

### `naming.ps1`
- No bugs found; logic verified correct by pre-launch audit
- `New-DeviceName`, `New-UserDeviceName`, and `Select-NamingMode` all covered by Pester tests
- Contains 8 `Write-Host` calls in `Select-NamingMode` for the interactive mode prompt — covered by the project-wide `PSAvoidUsingWriteHost` exclusion (BUG-006a, ADR-007); no source change required

### `rename.ps1`
- ✅ `-NonInteractive:$NonInteractive` forwarded to `Get-NetworkContext` (BUG-002)
- ✅ Box-drawing characters in section dividers (`──`, `─`) replaced with ASCII (`--`, `-`) (BUG-006b)
- `Rename-DeviceSmart` still needs `SupportsShouldProcess` (OQ-002, checklist item 5) — deferred to v3.1
- Param additions for BUG-001 deferred to v3.1

### `tools/Get-Hashes.ps1`
- Works correctly; no changes needed
- The CI `manifest` job (OQ-005) performs equivalent verification automatically on every PR — no longer a manual-only step

### `tests/Hostname-Rename.Tests.ps1` *(new in v3)*
- Pester v5 test suite covering all pure-logic functions: `New-DeviceName`, `New-UserDeviceName`, `Get-SerialLast4` cleaning and padding, `Get-UserName` UPN cleaning steps, `Select-NamingMode` switch precedence, `Get-NetworkContext` mapping and fallback, and a full integration check of the 15-character NetBIOS limit across all valid department/type combinations
- No WMI or OS dependency — all tests run in CI without a real Windows device
- Run locally: `Invoke-Pester ./tests/Hostname-Rename.Tests.ps1 -Output Detailed`
- ✅ Section-divider chars (`─`), inline arrows (`→`), and em dashes (`—`) replaced with ASCII equivalents (BUG-006b)
- ✅ `$clean` scriptblock in `Get-UserName name cleaning` Describe block promoted to `$script:clean` so PSScriptAnalyzer recognises the cross-block use; assignment plus all eight call sites updated (BUG-006c)
- ✅ `Get-SerialLast4` Describe restructured (BUG-008): helper scriptblock moved from Context body level (Discovery phase, invisible at Run time in Pester v5) into a Describe-level `BeforeAll` using `$script:fn`. Empty `InModuleScope -Scriptblock { }` removed. Three duplicated inline helper copies in the first Context deduplicated against the new `BeforeAll`.

### `.github/workflows/ci.yml` *(new in v3)*
- Four jobs: `lint`, `test`, `manifest`, `placeholder` — see OQ-005 for detail
- `lint` runs a PS 5.1 / 7.x matrix via `windows-latest`
- `placeholder` runs on `ubuntu-latest` (faster, no PS needed for a grep check)
- ✅ `lint` job updated to pass `-Settings ./PSScriptAnalyzerSettings.psd1` to `Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer` (BUG-006a, ADR-007)
- ✅ `test` job's `Invoke-Pester` call switched to set `$cfg.Run.PassThru = $true` on the configuration object — Pester v5's Simple and Advanced parameter sets are mutually exclusive and `-Configuration` cannot be combined with `-PassThru` directly
- ✅ `actions/checkout` bumped v4 → v5 (4 references, one per job) and `actions/upload-artifact` bumped v4 → v6 (1 reference) ahead of the GitHub Node 20 deprecation. Both default to Node 24 and require Actions Runner 2.327.1+; GitHub-hosted runners are kept current automatically.

### `PSScriptAnalyzerSettings.psd1` *(new in v3)*
- Single-purpose lint-rule configuration consumed only by the CI `lint` job (ADR-007)
- Currently excludes `PSAvoidUsingWriteHost` only — see ADR-007 for the full rationale and rejected alternatives
- Not in `$MANIFEST` and not deployed at runtime — does not need a manifest entry
- New rule exclusions added here in future require updating ADR-007 with the rationale

### `CONTRIBUTING.md` *(new in v3)*
- Deployment Workflow (step-by-step, fork and canonical repo)
- Customisation points: adding gateways, departments, device types, `$GATEWAY_MAP` externalisation
- Local test instructions
- PR process and code style requirements
- v3.1 planned work table

### `README.md`
- ✅ `-Folder` description corrected — documents `C:\Users` profile selection accurately (BUG-001)
- ✅ `-FolderPath` and `-Username` marked as planned v3.1 (BUG-001 Option 3)
- ✅ "Network access to log share" requirement removed — no logging code exists (OQ-001)
- ✅ Gateway map example updated to RFC 5737 IPs and two-character `AC` org code (ADR-004, ADR-006)
- ✅ ORG code two-character constraint called out explicitly in Name Format section (ADR-006)
- ✅ Valid codes section added — departments and device types with WMI detection detail
- ✅ `PB` (Pizza Box) added as planned v3.1 device type
- ✅ `CONTRIBUTING.md` reference added (checklist item 8)
